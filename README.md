# PACMAN
PACMAN is a rewrite of of jprx's PacmanAttack, which utilises a hardware exploit that allows to bypass PAC (pointer authentication) on all M1 SoC's. Originally coded in Rust.

# Version support
Currently isn't functional, however macOS support will arrive as soon as tests.c is fixed and when I've tested it on a M1 Mac.
