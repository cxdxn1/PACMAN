# PACMAN
PACMAN is a rewrite of of jprx's PacmanAttack, which utilises a hardware exploit that allows to bypass PAC (pointer authentication) on all M1 SoC's. Originally coded in Rust.

# Version support
Currently isn't functional. tests.c needs a fix for this to support macOS. Feel free to fix this if you want but note that this is a public archive, no PRs will be accepted due to PACMAN being implemented into the Procurus bootstrap a long time ago (I found this out recently).
